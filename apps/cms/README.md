# Logos CMS

Payload CMS 3.83 admin app on Next.js 16. Admin UI lives at `/admin`, the app runs on port **3001**.

Postgres is **not** the production source of truth for content — it stores users, sessions, drafts, and PR cache. Published content changes flow through the GitHub "Create PR" workflow targeting `develop`. See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the content-workflow rules.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=24 <25`
- pnpm `11.1.0` (via Corepack: `corepack enable`)
- A reachable Postgres instance (local, Supabase, or the bundled Docker Postgres)
- For Docker deploys: Docker + Docker Compose

All commands run **from the monorepo root** so pnpm can resolve workspace packages (`@repo/content`, etc.).

---

## Development

Local development runs `next dev` directly against your own Postgres, with Payload schema auto-sync enabled.

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp apps/cms/.env.example apps/cms/.env
```

Fill in at minimum:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PAYLOAD_SECRET` | Required to boot. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` | CMS origin — defaults to `http://localhost:3001`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` | Web frontend origin — defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. |

The `GITHUB_*` variables are only required to exercise the Admin "Create PR" action. See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for every option and its default.

> Isolate dev data from other environments by setting `PAYLOAD_DB_SCHEMA=payload_dev` when sharing one Postgres database.

### 2. Run

```bash
pnpm --filter cms dev          # from the repo root
# or
pnpm dev:cms                   # turbo wrapper (also builds workspace deps)
```

The dev wrapper (`scripts/dev.ts`) starts Next on port 3001 and auto-accepts Payload's interactive schema-push prompt. It **refuses to run in deployment environments** — production/staging must use the build/start path with reviewed migrations, never local dev schema sync.

### Common tasks

```bash
pnpm --filter cms lint               # eslint, zero warnings
pnpm --filter cms check-types        # payload typegen + tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter cms test               # node:test suite
pnpm --filter cms generate-types     # regenerate Payload types after schema changes
pnpm --filter cms generate-import-map
```

Run `generate-types` after any Payload collection or schema change that affects generated types.

---

## Production deployment (Docker)

The production image bundles the built monorepo and runs `next start`. The build context **must be the monorepo root** so pnpm can resolve workspace packages.

### Option A — Docker Compose (recommended)

Brings up the CMS plus a self-hosted Postgres on an internal network. From the repo root:

```bash
# 1. Create the env file and fill in real values
cp apps/cms/.env.docker.example .env.docker

# 2. Build and start
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.docker up -d --build
```

Required values in `.env.docker`:

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | Credentials for the bundled Postgres. |
| `PAYLOAD_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` | **Baked into the client bundle at build time** — must be the real public CMS origin. Changing it requires a rebuild. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` | **Build-time** public web origin (same caveat). |
| `CMS_PORT` | Host port mapped to the container's `:3000` (default `3001`). |

The compose file constructs `DATABASE_URL` automatically from the Postgres vars and connects over the internal network — Postgres is **not** published to the host by default.

What's persisted:

- **`pgdata`** volume — Postgres data
- **`cms_uploads`** volume — uploaded media (`/app/apps/web/public/cms/uploads`)

The container entrypoint applies database migrations before the server starts, so the schema is ready on first boot — no manual step needed. See [Database migrations](#database-migrations) below for how this works and how to add a migration.

Put a reverse proxy (TLS termination) in front of `CMS_PORT` in production.

### Option B — standalone image

Build and run the image against an external Postgres (e.g. Supabase). Build from the repo root:

```bash
docker build -f apps/cms/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://cms.logos.co \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL=https://logos.co \
  -t logos-cms .
```

Run, injecting runtime secrets:

```bash
docker run -d --name logos-cms -p 3001:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db' \
  -e PAYLOAD_SECRET='<openssl rand -hex 32>' \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL='https://cms.logos.co' \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL='https://logos.co' \
  -v cms_uploads:/app/apps/web/public/cms/uploads \
  logos-cms
```

> `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` are inlined into the client bundle at **build time**, so they must be the real public origins passed as `--build-arg`. `DATABASE_URL` and `PAYLOAD_SECRET` are **not** baked in — they're supplied at runtime, and the build never connects to the database.

### Build vs. runtime variables

| Variable | When it's read | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` | **Build time** (inlined into client bundle) | Must be real public origins; changing requires a rebuild. |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `PAYLOAD_SECRET` | **Runtime** | Never baked into the image. |
| `PAYLOAD_DB_SCHEMA`, `PAYLOAD_DB_POOL_MAX` | Runtime | Defaults: `payload`, `10`. |
| `PAYLOAD_DB_PUSH` | Runtime | Only affects **local dev** (`NODE_ENV !== production`). Ignored in production — see [Database migrations](#database-migrations). |
| `GITHUB_*` | Runtime | Optional — only for the Admin "Create PR" action. |

### Database migrations

Payload **never** auto-syncs the schema (`push`) when `NODE_ENV=production` — that includes both self-hosted Docker and Vercel. Production schema is owned entirely by the reviewed SQL migrations in [`src/migrations/`](./src/migrations/).

**How it runs in Docker:** the container's [entrypoint](./docker-entrypoint.sh) runs `payload migrate` before `next start`. Migrations are idempotent — already-applied ones (tracked in the `payload-migrations` table) are skipped — so a fresh database is set up on first boot and restarts are no-ops.

**Local dev** uses schema auto-push instead (`PAYLOAD_DB_PUSH` defaults on; set `PAYLOAD_DB_PUSH=false` to disable), so you normally don't run migrations during development.

**When you change a collection or schema**, generate a migration and commit it alongside the code:

```bash
pnpm --filter cms migrate:create   # generate a new migration from current schema
pnpm --filter cms migrate:status   # list applied / pending migrations
pnpm --filter cms migrate          # apply pending migrations (run against the target DB)
```

The generated file under `src/migrations/` and the updated `src/migrations/index.ts` **must be committed** — production applies exactly what's in that directory.

### Health check

The image exposes a health endpoint used by Docker's `HEALTHCHECK`:

```
GET /api/health
```

## Environment file reference

| File | Used by | Committed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`.env.example`](./.env.example) | Local dev template → copy to `apps/cms/.env` | template only |
| [`.env.docker.example`](./.env.docker.example) | Docker Compose template → copy to repo-root `.env.docker` | template only |

Never commit the filled-in `.env` / `.env.docker` files — secrets are injected at runtime, never baked into the image.
